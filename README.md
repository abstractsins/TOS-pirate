# TOS-pirate
a tool for playing as Pirate in Town of Salem

What you have here is a JavaScript node program assisting you as Pirate in the online game "Town of Salem." It is simply a tool I created because I can.

FIRST: run the program in the terminal as "node path/TOS-pirate NUMBER" where number is your player number in the game. You will then be given instructions.

Use the program to randomly select a target for plundering and a random strategy, ala Rock Paper Scissors. Enter a number to keep track of the dead and recently plundered.
